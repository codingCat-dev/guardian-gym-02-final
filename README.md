# guardian-gym-02-final


Final Version of my fictional gym website Guardian Gym
Website was built using HTML, CSS compiled in SASS, JavaScript,
RanomUser api and leaflet.js was used.
However leaflet is not avaliable on breakpoints smaller then 650px.


Most focus here was some simple functionality, code-refactoring, small details.
Hopefully the design look better then previous üçæ
